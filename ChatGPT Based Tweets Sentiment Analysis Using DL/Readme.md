ChatGPT-Based Tweets Sentiment Analysis Using Deep Learning

GOAL

I wanted to perform Sentiment Analysis on the Tweets on ChatGPT using Deep learning.

DATASET

DESCRIPTION

Sentiment analysis on ChatGPT tweets involves using NLP to analyze emotions and attitudes expressed in tweets by the language model. It categorizes tweets as positive, negative, or neutral, providing insights into the overall emotional tone of the content. However, it may not fully capture nuances like humor and sarcasm. Regular updates improve accuracy in understanding human emotions.

WHAT I HAD DONE

I have done data processing, data visualisation and then finally applied LSTM and BiLSTM on the dataset.

MODELS USED

LSTM and BiLSTM

LIBRARIES NEEDED

Mentioned in requirements.text file.

VISUALIZATION

ACCURACIES
LSTM : 0.6863
BiLSTM : 0.6858

As I have only run 10 epochs each for both the models, accuracy is showing less. If more epochs are run, the accuracy will definitely increase.

CONCLUSION

After the sentiment analysis is performed, it is showing that majority of the tweets are neutral in nature and both LSTM and BiLSTM showed good results even on low epochs. Thus showing, that if more epochs are run, the accuracy of model will increase.
